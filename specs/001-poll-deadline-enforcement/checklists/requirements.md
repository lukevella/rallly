# Specification Quality Checklist: Poll Deadline Enforcement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-17  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items pass. The specification:
- Contains no implementation details (no mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or APIs)
- Focuses on user value and business needs
- Is written in plain language for stakeholders
- Has complete mandatory sections
- Contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all requirements are clear)
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Acceptance scenarios are well-defined for each user story
- Edge cases are comprehensively identified
- Scope is clearly defined with out-of-scope items listed
- Dependencies and assumptions are documented

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All user stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and independently testable
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (percentages, time limits, counts)
- No technical implementation details present in requirements or success criteria
