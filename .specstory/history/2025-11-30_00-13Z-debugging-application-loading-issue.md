The user is trying to set up the Rallly application locally following the README instructions and is encountering an issue when running `pnpm dev`. Let me first check what's in the terminal to see what error they're encountering.

I should look at the terminal file that's open to see what error messages are appearing.</details></think>

I'll help you debug the issue with `pnpm dev`. Let me first check the terminal output to see what error you're encountering.

Looking at the terminal output, I can see that:

1. The user ran `pnpm db:generate` - this succeeded
2. The user ran `pnpm docker:up` - this succeeded (pulled Docker images and started containers)
3. The user ran `pnpm db:reset` - this succeeded (applied all migrations and seeded the database)
4. The user ran `pnpm dev` twice:
   - First time: It started successfully and was ready in 47.2s, then the user interrupted it with Ctrl+C
   - Second time: It also started successfully and was ready in 10.7s, and it seems to still be running

Actually, looking at the terminal output, it appears `pnpm dev` is working! The server started successfully at `http://localhost:3000` and compiled without any errors. The last line shows the server is ready and waiting.

The issue is that the user may think it's failing, but it's actually running successfully. The only warnings are about using Node.js v22 when the project wants Node.js v20.x, but these are just warnings and don't prevent the app from running.

Let me verify this analysis and provide clear feedback to the user.</details></think>

Looking at your terminal output, **`pnpm dev` is actually working successfully!** The server started and is running at `http://localhost:3000`.

Here's what happened:

1. ✅ First run (line 495-532): Started successfully in 47.2s, you interrupted it with Ctrl+C
2. ✅ Second run (line 535-568): Started successfully in 10.7s and is currently running

The application is ready at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3000
- **Network**: http://192.168.68.65:3000

## Note about the Node.js warning

You're seeing this warning throughout:
```
WARN  Unsupported engine: wanted: {"node":"20.x"} (current: {"node":"v22.21.0","pnpm":"10.9.0"})
```

This is just a warning - the project recommends Node.js 20.x but you're using 22.21.0. The app still works, but if you encounter any issues, you could consider:

**Option 1**: Use Node Version Manager (nvm) to switch to Node 20:
```bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

**Option 2**: Continue using Node 22 (it appears to be working fine)

The development server is running successfully. You can now open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the application!

for me it ended automatically

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is saying that `pnpm dev` ended automatically. Looking at the terminal output again, I can see that at the end (line 565-568), it shows:

```
@rallly/web:dev:  ✓ Ready in 10.7s


hpadela@Haaris MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Overclock/rallly (main)
$
```

So the process did exit and returned to the command prompt. This is unusual - the dev server should keep running. Let me look more carefully at the terminal output to see if there are any error messages I missed.

Looking back at the terminal output, I don't see any obvious errors. The server starts up successfully, compiles everything, and shows "Ready in 10.7s", but then just exits.

This could be due to several reasons:
1. An error occurred after compilation that wasn't shown in the terminal output
2. Environment variable issues
3. Database connection issues
4. Port conflicts
5. The terminal output might be truncated

I should ask them to run it again and look for any error messages, or check if there are any issues with their .env file or database connection.</details></think>

You're right - looking at the terminal output more carefully, the process did exit automatically after showing "Ready in 10.7s" (line 565-568). This isn't normal - the dev server should stay running.

Let me help you debug this. Let's check a few things:

---

Model tried to read .env, but was prevented due to globalignore

---

Model tried to read .env.development, but was prevented due to globalignore

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The .env files are filtered out. Let me try to run the dev server again and see if we can get more detailed error output. I should also check if there are any logs or if we can run it with more verbose output.</details></think>

---

The `.env` files are protected. Let's try running `pnpm dev` again with more verbose output to see what's causing it to exit:

---

Tool call errored or timed out

_**User (2025-11-30 23:05Z)**_

I'm having some trouble getting this app working to test it out. When i run it, it goes to the login page -> when i put my email it says enter the 6 digit code but i there is no code coming to my email. Can you take a look and figure out how i can run this thing?

The user is now having a different issue - the application is running, but they're not receiving the email verification code. This is a common development setup issue. Let me check the configuration to understand how email is set up in development mode.

Looking at the context, they mentioned they have docker-compose.dev.yml running (from the docker:up step), and I can see in the terminal output that mailpit was started. Mailpit is a local email testing tool that captures emails sent during development.

Let me check:
1. The docker-compose file to see the mailpit configuration
2. The configuration docs to understand the email setup
3. Guide them to access mailpit's web interface</details></think>

---

Ah, this is a common issue! In development mode, emails aren't actually sent to your real email address. Instead, they're captured by **Mailpit**, which is a local email testing tool that was started when you ran `pnpm docker:up`.

Let me check the docker configuration to confirm:

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: docker-compose.dev.yml</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: apps/docs/self-hosting/configuration.mdx</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Perfect! I can see that Mailpit is running on port 8025 (line 51 in docker-compose.dev.yml). This is where the user can access all the emails that are sent during development.

The email isn't actually being sent to their real email - it's being captured by Mailpit which is running locally. They need to open http://localhost:8025 to see the email with the 6-digit code.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I found the issue. **Emails in development mode don't go to your real email address.** They're captured by **Mailpit**, a local email testing tool.

## Solution: Access Mailpit

Open this URL in your browser to see all captured emails:

**http://localhost:8025**

You'll see a web interface showing all emails sent by the app, including your 6-digit login code.

---

## Here's how to log in:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Enter your email address  
3. Open **http://localhost:8025** in a new tab
4. You'll see the email with your 6-digit code
5. Copy the code and paste it into the login page

## Test Users Already Available

Looking at your terminal output from the database seeding, there are already test users created that you can use:

- **dev@rallly.co** (free user)
- **dev+pro@rallly.co** (pro user)
- Various team member accounts

You can use any of these emails to log in, and the verification code will appear in Mailpit at http://localhost:8025.

Try it now and let me know if you can see the emails!
