Rallly is made available in different languages by volunteer translators.
Translations can be submitted through [Crowdin](https://crwd.in/rallly).
Submitting translations is super easy and doesn't require any coding skills.

## Sign Up to Crowdin

The first thing you need to do is [create a Crowdin account](https://accounts.crowdin.com/register). Crowdin offers a user-friendly interface to submit translations.
You can then join the project using this link: https://crwd.in/rallly

Once you've joined the project:

1. Pick the language you'd like to translate
2. Select a file (each file contains text for different parts of the site)
3. Start translating!

## Tips for Translators

Here are a few things to keep in mind when translating.

### Punctuation

Pay close attention to how phrases are punctuated.

```
Name:
```

If a sentence ends with a period (.) or a colon (:), you will want to include that in your translation.

```
❌ Nombre
✅ Nombre:
```

### Variables

Variables are placeholders for content which can change. They look like this:

```
Hi {name}, welcome back!
```

`{name}` is a variable which will be replaced with the user's name. Please make sure variables remain unchanged when translating.

```
❌ Salut {nom}, bienvenue!
✅ Salut {name}, bienvenue!
```

### Tags

Tags can be used to create a hyperlink or change the appearance of some text (ex. bold, italics etc…). They look like this:

```
Go to <a>page</a>
```

The tags should remain wrapped around the same content and should not be translated. The contents between the tags should be translated (unless they are a [variable](#variables)).

```
❌ Gehen Sie zur Seite
❌ <a>Gehen Sie zur Seite</a>
❌ Gehen Sie zur <a>page</a>
✅ Gehen Sie zur <a>Seite</a>
```

### Plurals

<Note>
  We use [ICU message format](https://crowdin.com/blog/2022/04/13/icu-guide) to
  format our plurals
</Note>

Plurals are like special rules that help make sure a message is written correctly when you're using different values.

For example, the following message will display **1 option** if count is `1` or **2 options** if count is anything else.

```
{count, plural, one {# option} other {# options}}
```

Note that `#` is a placeholder for the value of `count`.

If your language requires more than one plural form, you can add additional rules.

```
{count, plural, one {# опция} few {# опции} other {# опций}}
```

### Register

For languages that have different registers (informal vs. formal), the general advise is to use an **informal** register. However, there may be exceptions for certain languages so if you are not sure please [reach out](#contact).
