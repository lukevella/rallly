If you see your response but it doesn't habe this badge, it means we can't tell
that you're the same person, either because you are using a different device or
browser or because your cookies have been deleted. In this case you may need to
contact the organizer of your poll to delete your response so that you can make
a new one.

If you enter your email when you create a response, you will receive a link that
will allow you to edit your response from anywhere.

### What if I can't edit my response?

Rallly uses cookies in your browser to recognize you as the creator of a
response. If your cookies have been deleted since you created your response or
you are using a different device/browser, it may not be possible to edit your
response.

In this case you should ask the administrator of the poll to either delete your
response so that you can create a new one or to edit your response for you.
