### Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I edit my response?">
    Rallly uses cookies in your browser to recognize you as the creator of a
    response. If your cookies have been deleted or you are using a different
    device/browser, you may no longer be recognized as the user who created the response.

In this case you should ask the administrator of the poll to either delete your
response so that you can create a new one or to edit your response for you.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I avoid losing access to my own response?">
  If you enter your email address when you submit your response, you will
  receive a confirmation email with a link that allows you to edit your response from
  anywhere.
