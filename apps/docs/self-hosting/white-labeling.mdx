White labeling allows you to customize the appearance of your Rallly instance to match your organization's branding. You can change the application name, primary colors, logos, and hide attribution text.

## What You Can Customize

- **Application Name** - Change the name displayed in page titles, navigation, and emails
- **Primary Colors** - Set custom brand colors for both light and dark modes
- **Logos** - Use your own logos for the application and emails
- **Attribution** - Hide the "Powered by Rallly" text in polls and emails

## Configuration

All white labeling options are configured via environment variables. See the [Configuration Options](/self-hosting/configuration#branding) page for the full list of available settings.

## Example

Here's an example of a complete white labeling configuration in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  rallly:
    image: lukevella/rallly:4
    environment:
      # ... other required environment variables ...

      # White labeling
      APP_NAME: "Acme Scheduler"
      PRIMARY_COLOR: "#0066cc"
      PRIMARY_COLOR_DARK: "#3399ff"
      LOGO_URL: "https://example.com/logo.svg"
      LOGO_URL_DARK: "https://example.com/logo-dark.svg"
      LOGO_ICON_URL: "https://example.com/icon.png"
      HIDE_ATTRIBUTION: "true"
```

## Viewing Current Settings

You can view the current branding configuration in the [Control Panel](/self-hosting/control-panel) under the **Branding** section. These settings are read-only in the UI and must be changed via environment variables.

## Requirements

- **Enterprise License with White Label Add-on**: White labeling features are only available with an active Enterprise license that includes the white label add-on.
- Without the add-on, your instance will use the default Rallly branding regardless of environment variable settings.

To inquire about Enterprise licensing, please fill out our [Enterprise Requirements Survey](https://app.formbricks.com/s/cmebvnf2ohvjkt901eefxsonr).
