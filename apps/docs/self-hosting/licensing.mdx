Rallly is open-source and always free for personal use.
If you want to run a multi-user setup, we ask that you purchase a license key.

## Activating Your License

Once you have your license key, you can activate it in your self-hosted Rallly instance:

1.  Log in to your Rallly instance as an administrator.
2.  Navigate to the [Control Panel](/self-hosting/control-panel).
3.  Select **License**.
4.  Enter your license key in the provided field and click **Activate**.

Your instance will now be licensed for multi-user access according to your chosen tier.
