Rallly is open-source and always free for personal use.
If you want to run a multi-user setup, we ask that you purchase a license key.

## Activating Your License

Once you have your license key, you can activate it in your self-hosted Rallly instance:

1.  Log in to your Rallly instance as an administrator.
2.  Navigate to the [Control Panel](/self-hosting/control-panel).
3.  Select **License**.
4.  Enter your license key in the provided field and click **Activate**.

Your instance will now be licensed for multi-user access according to your chosen tier.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="What constitutes a user?">
Only individuals with a **registered user account** on your Rallly instance count towards your user limit. People who participate in polls without being registered (i.e., guest voters) **do not** count as users for licensing purposes.
