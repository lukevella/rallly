Managed hosting is a service where a hosting provider takes care of provisioning the underlying infrastructure and some of the day-to-day maintenance of the app such as keeping it up to date.

## Revenue Sharing Providers

By choosing a hosting provider that shares revenue with us, you are not only getting the best service for your needs, but also supporting the development and maintenance of Rallly.
These providers understand the value of our open source project and are committed to helping us grow.
We appreciate their support and hope you will consider using their services.
