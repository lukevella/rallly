description: How to Self-Host Rallly
---

Rallly is 100% open-source and available under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)](https://github.com/lukevella/rallly/blob/main/LICENSE)
which allows you to run your own instance of Rallly for free for both personal and commercial use.

## Official Docker Image

The best way to self-host Rallly is using the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/lukevella/rallly).
This image contains a build that is specifically intended for self-hosting.
It is updated regularly but it is _not_ guaranteed to be up-to-date with the latest version of Rallly.
If you want to have access to the latest features and bug fixes, you should consider using the [official managed service](https://rallly.co).

<Note>
  Though it is technically possible to build and run Rallly from its
  [source-code](https://github.com/lukevella/rallly), it is not recommended and
  we do not provide support for this.
</Note>

## Pricing

Rallly is **completely free** to self-host but for users who wish to contribute to the project,
please check out the [pricing](/self-hosting/pricing) page.

## Get Started

Depending on how comfortable you are with technical things, you can either run Rallly on your own server or choose a managed hosting provider that will do it for you.
