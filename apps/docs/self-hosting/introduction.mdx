## What is Self-Hosting?

Self-hosting refers to the practice of running your own instance of Rallly on your own server.

The main advantage of self-hosting is the autonomy it affords, but it also requires more technical knowledge and maintenance, as well as the potential security risks of managing your own infrastructure.

## Get Started

Depending on how comfortable you are with technical things, you can either run Rallly on your own server or choose a managed hosting provider that will do it for you.
