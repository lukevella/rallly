Self-hosting Rallly gives you complete control over your instance and your data. You can customize it to your needs, integrate it within your own infrastructure, and manage user access directly.

## The Official Docker Image

The primary and **officially supported method** for self-hosting Rallly is by using our **official Docker image**. This image contains a build specifically optimized for self-hosting, with features like billing automatically disabled and no feature-gating.

These guides will walk you through using the Docker image:

*   **[Installation](/self-hosting/installation/docker):** Setting up Rallly using Docker.
*   **[Configuration](/self-hosting/configuration):** Customizing your instance with environment variables.
*   **[Licensing](/self-hosting/licensing):** Understanding when a license is needed and how to manage it.
*   **[Control Panel](/self-hosting/control-panel):** Managing your instance, users, and settings.

<Note>
  While Rallly's source code is publicly available, self-hosting directly from the source code is not officially supported. For a stable and optimized experience, please use the provided Docker image.
</Note>

## Licensing

Rallly is free to self-host for **personal, single-user setups**. For instances with **multiple users**, we ask that you purchase a license. This helps support the ongoing development and maintenance of Rallly. You can find more details about the different tiers and how to purchase a license on our [Licensing page](/self-hosting/licensing).

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have a basic understanding of Docker and server management. While we aim to make the process straightforward, some technical knowledge is beneficial.

If you're not ready to self-host or prefer a managed solution, you can always use the official Rallly service at [rallly.co](https://rallly.co).
