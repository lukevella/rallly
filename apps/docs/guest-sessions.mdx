  "ðŸ™ˆ When you vote on a poll, you may need to come back later and adjust your
  votes. Guest sessions allow you to do this without making an account and
  logging in."

A guest session is created automatically when you vote or comment on a poll. The
session data is stored as a cookie in your browser.

Guest sessions will remain active until you manually end them or your browser
cookies are wiped. **Once a guest session ends it cannot be resumed**.

### Ending a guest session

You can end a guest session by selecting **Forget me** from the dropdown menu.

### Limitations

- Since guest sessions are stored in your browser, you will need to use the same
  browser and the same device to edit your votes/comments.

- **If you end a guest session, it cannot be resumed**. The only way to have
  your votes and comments edited is to ask the administrator of a poll to edit
  them for you.

### Logging in

Logging in while you have an active guest session will automatically assign the
votes and comments you've made to an account. Once you do this, you can edit
your votes and comments from anywhere by logging in with the same email address.
