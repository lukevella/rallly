## What is Rallly?

Rallly is a tool for creating scheduling polls. It's designed to help people find a common time to schedule a meeting or event.

> Rallly is pronounced like "rally" but with an extra _L_.
>
> I wanted to call the product "Rally" because that's what it's for - rallying people together to make things happen.
> But, of course, the domain name was already taken. So, I did what any sane person would do - I added an extra _L_.
