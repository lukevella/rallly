## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How long does Rallly keep a poll? When will my poll be deleted?" >
Polls are deleted if all the date options are in the past and no one has
accessed the poll for over 30 days.

Demo polls are deleted after 1 day.

<Accordion title="How do I limit the number of participants for each option?">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I find a poll I created?" >
When you create a poll the link to the **admin page** is emailed to you. Use the
link inside the email to get back to your poll.

Alternatively, you can [log in](https://rallly.co/login) with the same email
address you used to create the poll and go to the
[profile page](https://rallly.co/profile) were you can see a list of all the
polls you created.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What times will my participants see if they are in different timezones?" >
When you create a poll with timed options, Rallly will assume that the times are
specific to your current location. When participants view your poll they will
see times adjusted to their time zone. This works well if:

- participants are in different time zones and the meeting is being held
  remotely

- all participants are in the same time zone

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my participants are in different time zones but the event is in a specific location?" >
You can choose **Ignore time zone** when specifying options to make sure
everyone sees the same times. If you forget to do that when you create the poll
you can always change it later by going to **Manage > Edit Options** on your
poll.
