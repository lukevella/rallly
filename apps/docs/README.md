# Support Docs

Live site: [https://support.rallly.co](https://support.rallly.co)

Our docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which is mostly [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) with the ability to use components inside.

This site is kindly built with and hosted by [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com).

## How to Run Locally

To preview your changes locally, you can use the [mintlify cli](https://mintlify.com/docs/development) to run a development server.

Install the cli globally:

```bash
yarn global add mintlify
```

Navigate to this directory (where you can find `mint.json`):

```bash
cd apps/docs
```

Start the development server:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

## Components

Mintlify provides a number of useful built-in components such as [Accordion](https://mintlify.com/docs/components/accordion), [Tabs](https://mintlify.com/docs/components/tabs) and [Callouts](https://mintlify.com/docs/components/callouts).
