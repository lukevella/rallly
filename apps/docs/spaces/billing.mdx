## How Seat-Based Billing Works

Rallly spaces use a seat-based pricing model that scales with your team size:

<Card title="Seat-Based Pricing Benefits" icon="users">
- **Easy scaling** - add or remove seats as your team changes
- **Centralized billing** - one subscription for your entire team
- **Pro features for all** - every member gets Pro benefits
</Card>

## Understanding Seats

### What is a Seat?
A seat represents one team member's access to your Pro space. Each member you invite to your space requires one seat.

### Seat Allocation
- **Used Seats**: Current number of active members in your space
- **Total Seats**: Maximum number of members you're paying for
- **Available Seats**: Remaining seats you can fill without increasing your bill

<Note>
You must have at least as many total seats as used seats. You cannot reduce total seats below your current member count.
</Note>

## Managing Your Subscription

To upgrade your space to Pro:
