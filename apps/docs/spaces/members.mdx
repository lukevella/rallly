## Managing Pending Invitations

### Invitation States
Invitations can be in several states:
- **Pending**: Invitation sent, waiting for acceptance
- **Expired**: Invitation has expired and needs to be resent
- **Accepted**: Person has joined your space

### Canceling Invitations
To cancel a pending invitation:

1. **Locate the pending invite**
2. **Click "Cancel"** to revoke the invitation
3. **Confirm the cancellation** - the invitation link will no longer work

## Seat Management and Members

### Seat Allocation
- **Used Seats**: Equal to your current member count
- **Available Seats**: How many more members you can invite
- **Total Seats**: Your current subscription level

### Adding Members vs Adding Seats
<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Available Seats">
    Before inviting someone, verify you have available seats in your billing settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Purchase Additional Seats (if needed)">
    If you're at capacity, increase your seat count through billing management first.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    Once you have available seats, you can invite new members immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>
