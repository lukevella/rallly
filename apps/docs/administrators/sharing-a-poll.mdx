### Sharing with participants

To share your poll with participants:

1. Click on the **Share** button to open the popover.

2. Inside the popover you will see your **participant URL** for your poll. Copy
   this URL and send it to your participants via email or whichever way you
   prefer to communicate with your participants.

### Sharing with administrators

In some cases, you might want to give others the ability to make changes to your
poll such as adding more options or changing the title and description. This can
only be done with the **admin URL**. The admin URL is sent to you by email when
you create a poll.
