## Introduction

Meeting polls allow participants to vote for their preferred dates so that you can find the best date for your meeting.

## Get started

To create a meeting poll, start by going to the [New Meeting Poll Page](https://rallly.co/new).

## 1. Enter the meeting details

Enter a meaningful title for your participants to see.
You can also add a description to give more context to your poll and a location if desired.

Click **Continue** to proceed.

## 2. Choose date options

Use the date picker to select the dates you want to offer your participants.
After selecting your dates, you can also add a time range by switching on **Specify times**.

<Accordion title="How do I manage timezones?">
If you do choose to specify times, Rallly will automatically detect and set the timezone from your browser
and participants will see times adjusted to their timezone when they vote. This behavior is ideal for remote meetings where
participants can be in different timezones.

If the event is happening at a physical location, you can change the timezone to **Ignore timezone**
to ensure that everyone will see the same times regardless of their timezone.
