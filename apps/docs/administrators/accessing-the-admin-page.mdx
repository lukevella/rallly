When you create a poll, you will receive two links via email. One of those links
is for the admin page where you can make changes to your poll.

</Frame>

Alternatively, if you log in with the same email address you used to create the
poll, you can access the admin page of any poll you created through the
[profile page](https://rallly.co/profile).
