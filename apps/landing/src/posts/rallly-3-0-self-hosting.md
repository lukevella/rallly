excerpt: An exciting announcement for self-hosters.
---

Rallly 3.0 was launched [back in June](/blog/rallly-3-0) and since then it has only been available for users on the cloud-hosted version here on [rallly.co](/). Today, I'm excited to announce the official release of Rallly 3.0 for self-hosting making Rallly the best self-hostable alternative to Doodle.

## How to use

For information on how to self-host your own instance of Rallly, check out the [self-hosting docs](https://support.rallly.co/self-hosting) which include step-by-step instructions for running Rallly on your own server.

## Pricing

This update is [available for free](https://support.rallly.co/self-hosting/pricing) and allows users to enjoy all the features available here on their own self-hosted instance. If you are willing and able, there is an option to pay a one-time free which will help support further development of this project.

## Upgrading from 2.x

If you are already self-hosting Rallly you can have a look at the [release notes](https://github.com/lukevella/rallly/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for instructions and information about breaking changes.

I hope you enjoy this update and as always please let me know if you have any [feedback](mailto:feedback@rallly.co).

Cheers!
