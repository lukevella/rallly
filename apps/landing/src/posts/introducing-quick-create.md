excerpt: Introducing Quick Create, a streamlined way to get started with Rallly.

One of the things that sets Rallly apart from other scheduling tools is its ability to create meeting polls without the need to sign up for an account. As we've grown and added more powerful features, we wanted to make sure new users could still get started quickly while having a clear path to discovering everything Rallly has to offer.

Our previous approach of giving full platform access to non-logged in users had some limitations:

- Users may not realize they're using the platform without an account
- Without signing up, users risk losing access to their created polls
- Advanced features remain undiscovered by guest users
- Supporting guest user access across all pages creates technical complexity

To create a better experience for everyone, we've introduced **Quick Create**. You'll find it right on the [login page](https://app.rallly.co/login), where you can instantly create and manage group polls without the need to sign up. When you're ready to do more, like accessing advanced features or ensuring long-term access to your polls, you can easily sign up and have all your existing polls automatically added to your account.

This change allows us to focus on developing new powerful features while keeping the initial experience simple and accessible for new users. It's a first step in a series of improvements to make Rallly even more user-friendly and powerful. Stay tuned for more updates!
