We're excited to introduce **Spaces** - Rallly's new team collaboration feature that transforms how organizations manage scheduling and billing. Instead of juggling multiple individual Pro subscriptions, Spaces brings your entire team together under one unified workspace.

## What are Spaces?

Spaces are designed for teams and organizations who want to streamline their scheduling workflow. With Spaces, you get centralized billing, member management, and seamless collaboration - all in one place.

### Key Benefits

**Centralized Billing** - One subscription covers all team members, simplifying your accounting and reducing administrative overhead.

**Team Collaboration** - Share and organize polls within your organization, making it easy to coordinate across departments and projects.

**Member Management** - Invite and manage team members from one central location with role-based permissions.

**Seat-Based Pricing** - Pay only for the seats you need and scale up or down as your team grows.

## How It Works

When you create a Space, you become the Space owner with full control over:

- **Team Invitations** - Add colleagues to your workspace instantly
- **Billing Management** - Handle payments and seat allocation from one dashboard  
- **Poll Organization** - Keep your team's scheduling organized and accessible
- **Access Control** - Manage who can create, edit, and finalize polls

All members of a Pro Space automatically get access to Pro features without needing individual subscriptions - including poll finalization, calendar invites, extended poll life, and priority support.

## Perfect for Growing Teams

Whether you're a startup coordinating standup meetings, a marketing agency scheduling client calls, or an enterprise managing cross-functional projects, Spaces scales with your needs. Add seats as you hire, remove them when team members leave, and never worry about subscription management again.

## Get Started Today

Ready to streamline your team's scheduling? Creating your first Space takes just a few clicks, and existing Pro users can easily migrate to the new team-based billing model.

Spaces represent our commitment to making Rallly the best scheduling solution for teams of all sizes. With your support, we'll continue building features that make coordination effortless.
