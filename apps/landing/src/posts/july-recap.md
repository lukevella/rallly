Wow, time flies!
It's been over a month since the [Rallly Pro launch](/blog/rallly-pro-launch).
A heartfelt thank you to each of you who subscribed ‚Äì your support means a lot.
Knowing that there is value in what I've built is a huge morale boost and drives me to push the boundaries even further!

## üìù What's new?

I've been burning the midnight oil to roll out features based on the [feedback](https://feedback.rallly.co) I've received. Here's some highlights:

**Easier Poll Creation** - Creating a meeting poll is now quicker than ever with our revamped poll creation form. We've streamlined the process, condensing everything onto a single page for a faster and more efficient setup.

**Hide participants/Hide scores** - Polls can now be configured with different behaviors.
You can keep your participant details private by hiding the participant list or avoid voting bias by hiding the poll results until after a participant has voted.

**Duplicate** - Create a copy of your poll. Use it as a template or share with different groups of participants.

**Table View Revamp** - The table view has been overhauled to improve it's readability. There's a lot less repetition and clutter making it easier to work with long lists of options.

## üéâ Grab Rallly Pro at Launch Pricing!

If you haven't jumped aboard yet, here's a little incentive.
The launch price for Rallly Pro is still up for grabs.
It's **$5/month** or, if you're looking for a real bargain, just **$2.50/month** when billed annually (**$30/year**).
As an early adopter, this rate can be yours to keep, **forever!**
That's right ‚Äì early adopters will not be impacted by future price increases.
You can upgrade to Rallly Pro from your [billing page](https://app.rallly.co/settings/billing).

### Pricing Updates

The current price is about 3 to 4 times cheaper than competitors in the same space.
My aim is to eventually price Rallly Pro to be in line with theirs but I'll be adjusting the price in stages as more features are released. A heads up for the future ‚Äì the next stage will be **$7/month** or **$42/year**.
The updated prices will kick in on **22nd August 2023** (so you have until then to lock in the current rate).

## üëç Thank you

To all the subscribers and sponsors who make it possible for me to continue my work here.

Cheers!
