I'm excited to announce a significant update that will be available soon - Rallly Pro. This is a new paid tier that will unlock new features for subscribers and help fund a new round of feature development that I am sure you will love.

To kick things off, Rallly Pro users will enjoy the following benefits:

## 1. Finalize Polls and Send Out Calendar Invites

Pro users will be able to select a final date for the poll and send out calendar invites to all participants. This is a highly requested feature that I plan to continue to improve and tailor to our Pro users' needs.

## 2. Priority Support

As a Rallly Pro user, you will receive priority support and exclusive access to an on-site live chat.

## 3. Vote on Feature Development

I will be launching surveys to Rallly Pro users to see what features you would like to see and your votes will have a direct impact on what gets built first.

## 4. Extended Poll Life

Rallly Pro users can keep their polls indefinitely and won't have to worry about losing their data.

## 5. Upcoming Features

You can expect to see more features being added soon such as:

- Setting a deadline
- Sending automated reminders
- Hiding participant names

I've also published a post outlining [the future of Rallly](/blog/the-future-of-rallly) which involves adding more solutions on top of the much loved polling feature. With your help we can turn this vision into a reality.

Thank you for your support and if you'd like to be notified when Rallly Pro is available you can subscribe below.

Happy scheduling :)
