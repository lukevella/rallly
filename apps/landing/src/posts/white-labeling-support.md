I'm pleased to announce that white labeling is now available for self-hosted Rallly instances.

This feature was built in response to a request from an enterprise client who needed their Rallly deployment to seamlessly integrate with their existing brand. It's now available to all Enterprise license holders as an optional add-on.

If you've been following along, you might remember I recently added [dark mode support](/blog/introducing-dark-mode) and mentioned that theming capabilities were on the way. White labeling is the realization of that work. You can now customize your instance's name, primary colors (for both light and dark modes), logos, and remove Rallly attribution entirely.

For technical details and configuration options, check out the [White Labeling documentation](https://support.rallly.co/self-hosting/white-labeling).

## Why an Enterprise Add-on?

Features like this take significant time to build and maintain. Offering white labeling as a paid add-on helps generate the revenue needed to keep developing new features and maintaining the project long-term. If your organization is interested in white labeling or other enterprise features, please fill out the [Enterprise Requirements Survey](https://app.formbricks.com/s/cmebvnf2ohvjkt901eefxsonr).

## What's Next?

I'm planning to bring branding customization to the space level as well. This will allow teams on the cloud-hosted version to customize their spaces with their own branding without needing to self-host.

Thanks for your continued support.
