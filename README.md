Self-hostable doodle poll alternative. Find the best date for a meeting with your colleagues or friends without the back and forth emails.

Built with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/), [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma), [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc) & [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

## üê≥ Quickstart with docker

_For running in a production environment_

Clone this repo and change directory to the root of the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukevella/rallly.git
cd rallly
```

Once inside the directory create a `.env` file where you can set your environment variables. There is a `sample.env` that you can use as a reference.

```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

_See [configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) to see what parameters are availble._

Build and run with `docker-compose`

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üíª Running locally

Clone this repo and change directory to the root of the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukevella/rallly.git
cd rallly
```

Copy the sample `.env` file then open it and set the variables.

```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

_See [configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) to see what parameters are availble._

Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

Next we need to run the database migrations to create our tables

```
yarn prisma migrate deploy
```

Start the Next.js server

```
# For development
yarn dev
# For production
yarn build
yarn start
```
